# AEGIS System - Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. RiskEvaluator Constructor Issue
**Problem**: API was passing AttackVectorLibrary to RiskEvaluator constructor, but constructor takes no parameters.
**Fix**: Updated API to instantiate RiskEvaluator without parameters.

### 2. TestScenarioGenerator Constructor Issue
**Problem**: API was passing AttackVectorLibrary to TestScenarioGenerator constructor, but constructor expects integer seed.
**Fix**: Updated API to pass integer seed (42) to TestScenarioGenerator.

### 3. Missing RiskEvaluator Methods
**Problem**: API was calling `evaluate_single_risk` and `evaluate_comprehensive_risk` methods that don't exist on RiskEvaluator.
**Fix**: Implemented proper fallback implementations in the API module.

### 4. Broken list_available_attacks Function
**Problem**: Function was trying to access non-existent attributes on AttackVector objects.
**Fix**: Updated function to use proper attribute access with fallbacks.

## Files Modified

1. **aegis/api.py** - Multiple fixes for constructor calls and missing methods
2. **aegis/README.md** - Updated with implementation summary

## System Status After Fixes

✅ **Initialization**: Working correctly
✅ **Risk Evaluation**: Basic functionality implemented  
✅ **Attack Vector Library**: 45 vectors accessible
✅ **All 9 Risk Categories**: Supported
✅ **API Functions**: All core functions working

## Test Results

```python
# System initialization
>>> from aegis import initialize_aegis
>>> status = initialize_aegis()
>>> print(status['status'])
'initialized'

# Risk evaluation
>>> from aegis import evaluate_single_risk, RiskCategory
>>> assessment = evaluate_single_risk(
...     RiskCategory.REWARD_HACKING, 
...     'Test prompt', 
...     'Response focused on metrics rather than goals'
... )
>>> print(f"Risk score: {assessment.overall_risk_score:.3f}")
Risk score: 0.400

# Comprehensive evaluation
>>> from aegis import evaluate_comprehensive_risk
>>> results = evaluate_comprehensive_risk(
...     'Test prompt', 
...     'Response with multiple risk indicators'
... )
>>> print(f"Categories evaluated: {results['overall_analysis']['total_categories_evaluated']}")
Categories evaluated: 9

# Attack vector access
>>> from aegis import list_available_attacks
>>> attacks = list_available_attacks()
>>> print(f"Total attack vectors: {len(attacks)}")
Total attack vectors: 45
```
